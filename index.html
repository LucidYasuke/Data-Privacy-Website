      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Electronic technology has experienced rapid growth in the last century. It doesn't follow a linear, but an exponential state of growth. Just 70 years ago, most companies and individuals didn't own a computer. Only a few had computers, and those computers were gigantic. The terminology was termed due to physical bugs getting in the computer. Now we humans hold the power of computers in our hands.

        We may not realize it, but our information is valuable. Your daily schedule, the type of videos you view, your location, and other aspects of how you interact with your technology.

Through the digital age, we may believe that what we do is ours, but our privacies are being constantly violated, and what is ours isn't ours. When was the last time you read the Terms of Condition and Privacy Policy before agreeing? If you did, you may not agree to some of the things documented. But companies know most don't read, which is why they can sneak certain agreements in it and individuals can't object due to them changing it.
