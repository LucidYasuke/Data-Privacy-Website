        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Electronic technology has experienced rapid growth in the last century. It doesn't follow a linear, but an exponential state of growth. Just 70 years ago, most companies and individuals didn't own a computer. Only a few had computers, and those computers were gigantic. The terminology was termed due to physical bugs getting in the computer. Now we humans hold the power of computers in our hands. This evolution of technology has had its positive and negative influences on humans.

          We may not realize it, but our information is valuable. Your daily schedule, the type of videos you view, your location, and other aspects of how you interact with your technology. Some companies even end up selling your information, making a profit off your active and passive habits. "Companies are hired to track which websites people visit and then use the information"<sup>[cite wikepedia]</sup>. For example, we don't think about the information that can be gained when we post an image on social media. The metadata, data of the data, that's given away in your photo can lead to your location, type of phone you have, time picture was taken, and more. Anyone, who has the ability, can read through these files,

          A parent won't see the harm in posting an image of their child on social media. Some parents have dedicated pages for pictures of their kids. But once that image is out, it can't be retrieved. The child may not be knowledgeable about it, but a future employer could pull up that photo. Through the digital age, we may believe that what we do is ours, but our privacies are being constantly violated, and what is ours isn't ours. When was the last time you read the Terms of Condition and Privacy Policy before agreeing? If you did, you may not agree to some of the things documented. But companies know most don't read, which is why they can sneak certain agreements in it and individuals can't object due to them changing it.
